3. **Probe for clarity**: If answer is vague, ask follow-up
4. **Accept "I don't know"**: Mark as `UNKNOWN` if user doesn't have answer
5. **Skip optional questions**: If user says "skip" or "next", move on
6. **Extract key points**: Summarize each answer into bullet points

### Handling Unknown Answers

When user says "I don't know", "not sure", "you decide", or similar:

```markdown
### {Question}
**Answer:** UNKNOWN
**Reason:** {why user doesn't know}
**Research Hint:** {from question's research_hints}
```

### Output Format (section file)

Write to `$SESSION_DIR/sections/${SECTION_NAME}.md`:

```markdown
