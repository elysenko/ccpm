# Research Contract: LLM-Based UI Code Generation Agent Methodologies

## Core Question

**What are the best methodologies and patterns for building an LLM-based agent that creates UI/frontend code?**

## Decision Context

This research informs the design of a UI generation agent. The findings will guide architectural decisions, tool selection, and implementation patterns.

## Audience

Technical (developers, architects designing AI-powered development tools)

## Scope

### Included
- LLM UI generation approaches and architectures
- Tools analysis (v0, Bolt, Lovable, Replit, Cursor, Claude Artifacts)
- Prompting strategies for UI/code generation
- Code output patterns (React, Tailwind, shadcn/ui)
- Multi-agent and single-agent patterns
- Self-debugging and iterative refinement
- Design-to-code pipelines (Figma, screenshot-to-code)
- Sandbox and execution environments
- Context management strategies

### Excluded
- Manual design workflows (Figma without AI)
- Non-LLM automation approaches
- General software development (backend-only, non-UI)
- Pricing/business model analysis

### Timeframe
Current state: 2024-2025 (extending to January 2026)

## Constraints

### Required Source Types
- Academic research (arXiv, ACL, ICLR, NAACL)
- Technical documentation (tool docs, API references)
- Practitioner guides (blog posts from tool creators, engineering teams)
- Open source implementations

### Banned Sources
- Marketing materials without technical substance
- User reviews without technical detail

## Output Format

Comprehensive research report with:
1. Executive summary
2. Methodology taxonomy
3. Tool comparison matrix
4. Implementation patterns catalog
5. Architectural recommendations
6. Risks and limitations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Comprehensive coverage of major LLM-to-UI approaches
- [ ] At least 3 independent sources for critical claims
- [ ] Actionable patterns for agent design
- [ ] Clear architectural recommendations with tradeoffs
- [ ] All claims cite sources
